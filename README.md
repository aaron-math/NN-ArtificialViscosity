Code developed during Summer 2020 to implement machine learning and neural networks to predict artificial viscosity values in Pyranda.

## Reference:
Pyranda -  https://github.com/LLNL/pyranda/tree/master

Work Title - "Shock Capturing using Neural Networks"

## Includes:
• .py files to create datasets
• .py files to implement TensorFlow Keras neural networks
• .py files that incorporate neural networks into shock dominated problems

## Shock-Dominated Problems:
• Burgers' Equation
• 1D Sod Shock Tube
• Shu-Osher Problem
• 2D Sod Shock Tube
• Sedov Blast Wave
• Triple Point Problem
